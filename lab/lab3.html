	<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
		<p>This lab mainly focuses on the performance of sensors connecting to the robot. 
		We have to fully understand how the ToF works and test the sensor's mode, speed, and reliability. 
		In this lab, we will also learn how to do soldering. </p>
		
	
	<h3 id="prelab-discussion">Prelab Discussion</h3>
		<p>By checking the datasheet provided in the lab guideline for the VL53L1X,
		the device has a maximum speed of 400 kbits/s and the I2C address is 0x52.</p>
		Normally, the ToF is connected with the Artemis individually and the I2C address is not a big problem even if two 
		ToF has the same address number. In some situations, when we want the two ToF to connect with the Artemis board at the same time, 
		only one ToF can work because they have the same I2C address. 
		To solve it, one of the sensor should add an extra wire to connect with the XSHUT on the ToF and pin8 on the Artemis board. 
		In Arduino code, we could first set the XSHUT as LOW to shut down one sensor, 
		and then we have to change the I2C address for the other sensor.  After that, we could reset the XSHUT to HIGH. 
		These two ToF then will have a different addresses and they can work well at the same time. </p>
		<p>For the placement of the sensor, I choose to place these two sensors at 90 degrees. 
		So, it can make sure it can detect obstacles from both front and side. 
		This can largely improve the safety of the robot. But if the obstacles are on the other side or the behind the robot, it will miss.</p>
		<p>The picture provided below is the sketch of the wiring diagram.</p>

	<h3 id="task-2-Artemis-scanning-for-I2C-device">Task 2: Artemis scanning for I2C device</h3>
		<p>The default I2C address is 0x52, which is 0101001. It can be get from the datasheet of VL53L1X. 
		The scanning for the I2C can be found by running the example code "Example05_Wire_I2C". 
		The address is shown on the serial monitor. The screenshot is shown below, which is 0x29. 
		That is because the LSBit is in R/W format and the address is shifted. Therefore, the address is matched. </p>

		<p>The table above is the Maximum distance vs. Distance mode under the ambient light table from the datasheet. 
		There are three different modes in total: short, medium, and long. We can get some simple relationships from the data provided. 
		With the long-distance mode, it has the biggest impact under strong ambient light. 
		And the short-distance mode has almost no impact under strong ambient light. </p>
		<p>For the robot, it should be better to choose the short-distance mode. 
		The robot is always used in some dangerous, dark, or accuracy-needed situations. 
		So, it is important to exclude the surrounding impact. </p>
		<p>With the short-distance mode, I gathered the data about measured distance and actual distance by using the code found in "Example1_ReadDistance". 
		The plot shown below is made by MATLAB. </p>
	<img class="img-responsive" src="https://leewx1020.github.io/lab_pic/lab3/task3.jpeg" alt=""width="600" height="600"/>
		The distance measured is very accurate that two lines on the plot only have a very small gap.
		But as the distance gets bigger, it becomes less accurate. The rannging time is around 54ms.</p>
